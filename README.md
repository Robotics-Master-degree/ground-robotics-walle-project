# Wall-e_project - Team B

The goal of the project is to demonstrate the knowledge acquired in the ground robotics moduleclasses, more specifically:

--SLAM –ability to build a map while localizing on it.
--Path planning –ability to calculate a path from a starting position to a goal destination, followingan optimality criteria.
--Autonomous  navigation –ability  to  follow  the  calculated  path,  with obstacle avoidancecapabilities.
-- Others –integration with solutions/algorithms from previous modules

#How to run?
Execute the following command: 

$ roslaunch turtlebot_nacho main.launch 

#Nodes
- Vision --> vision
- Point cluster --> cluster_detection
- Explorer --> my_configure
- Move_base --> turtlebot_nacho
- Brain --> cerebro_walle
